# Dock

An internal, zero-worker Google Drive <-> Discord integration bridge designed for a 3-person creative/digital agency. Maps individual client Discord channels to Google Drive folders with bidirectional synchronization, rich announcements, loop prevention, and strict idempotency.

## Quick Start for a New Developer (< 30 Minutes)

Follow these steps to spin up your isolated local development stack:

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone git@github.com:shonjoo/Dock.git
cd Dock
nvm use 20
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Your Isolated Test Stack
Every developer needs their own isolated test resources (see [docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md](docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md)):
1. Create a free test project in [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and run `supabase/migrations/20261007_init.sql` in the SQL Editor.
2. Create a test application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a bot, and invite it to your private test server with `applications.commands`, `Send Messages`, and `Attach Files` permissions.
3. In Google Cloud Console, enable Drive API, generate OAuth client credentials, and create a test folder in your Google Drive.

### 3. Generate Your Google Refresh Token
Run the interactive CLI helper:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/get-google-refresh-token.ts
```
Follow the browser consent prompt to generate your test `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`.

### 4. Create Your Local Environment File
Copy [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env.local`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
Fill in your test credentials (see [docs/SECRETS.md](docs/SECRETS.md) for details).

### 5. Register Discord Commands to Your Test Guild
```bash
npx tsx scripts/register-commands.ts
```

### 6. Run the Local Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Test Discord interactions locally via a tunnel (see [docs/LOCAL-DEV.md](docs/LOCAL-DEV.md)).
- Test Drive synchronization locally via the reconciliation route:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/drive/poll \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_LOCAL_CRON_SECRET>"
  ```
